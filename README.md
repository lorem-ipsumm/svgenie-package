# SVGenie

This is a simple package that allows web developers to convert SVGs into Typescript React components and import them into their projects with a single command.

All imported components come with a `props` argument that allows you to easily pass through any arguments (className, width, height, etc.) without having to explicity modify the file

# Usage

1. Go to https://svgenie.xyz and past in your desired SVG code
2. Click the `Add to project` button
3. A popup window will appear with a command that looks like `npx svgenie@latest [unique-id-for-component]`
4. Run the command in your project directory and your new React ready component will be imported
